This project is created with React, a JavaScript library to build fast and robust applications. Its basic or common elements are styled in App.css but it also uses styled-components package to style several components. For validation, the packages is-empty and Validator are used to validate if the input is empty or if it corresponds to certain patterns, like the number of a mastercard. Therefore, RegEx are used in validation. For the card details input fields the package Cleave is used which helps with the formatting of the card number input field, the expire date input field and the CVC input field.
